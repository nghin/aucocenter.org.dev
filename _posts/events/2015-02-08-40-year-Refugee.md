The Fall of Saigon occurred on April 30, 1975 when the North Vietnamese Communist Party captured Saigon, the capital city of South Vietnam.  In the years following the Fall of Saigon, a mass exodus occurred with the flight of millions of people, with many fleeing by boat (who were then referred to as "boat people").
